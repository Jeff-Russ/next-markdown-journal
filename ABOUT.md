# About This Branch: Simplest Journal Starter

This branch, simple_journal_starter, is the second most simple of all sub-projects in this repository. It differs from the simplest_journal_starter in that is has additional features listed in these section on [Incrementally Added Features](#incrementally-added-features)

This sub-project is based on [Brad Traversy's DevSpace Blog](https://github.com/bradtraversy/devspace-blog), which is part of his [Next.js Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-dev-to-deployment).

* Caching of posts
* Tailwind CSS
