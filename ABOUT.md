# About This Branch: Simplest Journal Starter

This branch, simplest_journal_starter, is the most most simple of all sub-projects in this repository and may be a good starting place for customization that differ from those seen in all other branches. 

This sub-project is based on [Brad Traversy's Next Markdown Blog](https://github.com/bradtraversy/next-markdown-blog) and its accompanying [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrjeefD8sac&list=PLYZPgijbvzkZjFnjis7CYKyJgBt8ZSZ7X&index=3&ab_channel=TraversyMedia).
